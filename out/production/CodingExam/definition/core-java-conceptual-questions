What is IDE?
A.A Java IDE is an integrated development environment for programming in Java; many also provide functionality for other languages,
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
ECLIPSE NETBEANS INTELLIJ
Explain the entire java life cycle.
code/ text file --- save as java file.java, compile it with a compiler, will create a class, bytecode file, once verified the JVM runs it, reads it and translate it to the operating system
what is class?
A class, in the context of Java, are templates that are used to create objects, and to define object data types and methods
What is object?
A Java object is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data. An object has a state and behavior
What is the entry point of an application?
the main method
Why main is static?
 static method and static data are loaded into separate memory inside JVM called context which is created when a class is loaded. If main method is static than it will be loaded in JVM context and are available to execution.
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
java.lang.Object
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
path is a mediator between developer and operating system to inform binary file path where as Classpath is a mediator between developer and compiler to inform the library file path those are used in our source code

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
abstract keyword is used to create an abstract class and it can be used with methods also whereas interface keyword is used to create interface and it can’t be used with methods.
Subclasses use extends keyword to extend an abstract class and they need to provide implementation of all the declared methods in the abstract class unless the subclass is also an abstract class whereas subclasses use implements keyword to implement interfaces and should provide implementation for all the methods declared in the interface.
Abstract classes can have methods with implementation whereas interface provides absolute abstraction and can’t have any method implementations.
Abstract classes can have constructors but interfaces can’t have constructors.
Abstract class have all the features of a normal java class except that we can’t instantiate it. We can use abstract keyword to make a class abstract but interfaces are a completely different type and can have only public static final constants and method declarations.
Abstract classes methods can have access modifiers as public, private, protected, static but interface methods are implicitly public and abstract, we can’t use any other access modifiers with interface methods.
A subclass can extend only one abstract class but it can implement multiple interfaces.
Abstract classes can extend other class and implement interfaces but interface can only extend other interfaces.
We can run an abstract class if it has main() method but we can’t run an interface because they can’t have main method implementation.
Interfaces are used to define contract for the subclasses whereas abstract class also define contract but it can provide other methods implementations for subclasses to use.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
no, we can only implement the interface and extend the abstract class
what is Access Specifier?
access modifiers in Java helps to restrict the scope of a class, constructor , variable , method or data member. There are four types of access modifiers available in java:

Default – No keyword required
Private
Protected
Public
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. such as
inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism.
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
Built-in Packages are imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
is a collection of prewritten packages, classes, and interfaces with their respective methods, fields and constructors. Similar to a user interface, which facilitates interaction between humans and computers, an API serves as a software program interface facilitating interaction.
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
To reduce the complexity and simplify the language, multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

Consider a scenario where A, B, and C are three classes. The C class inherits A and B classes. If A and B classes have the same method and you call it from child class object, there will be ambiguity to call the method of A or B class.

Since compile-time errors are better than runtime errors, Java renders compile-time error if you inherit 2 classes. So whether you have same method or different, there will be compile time error.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists are different
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exceptions in Java. An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions
try and catch function
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Résultats de recherche d'images pour « definition of static keyword in java »
The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves. So if you have a variable: private static int i = 0; and you increment it ( i++ ) in one instance, the change will be reflected in all instances.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
giving a final value to a  variable.
What is final, finally and finalize?
Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed. Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not. Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
yes
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
default constructor.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
initialise a value to a variable.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
What is JVM stand for ?
java virtual machine
Is JVM platform independent?
no it is not
What version of java are you using?
java 8
What is JAR stand for ?
java archive
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
JDK is package of JRE JVM AND THE LIBRARY
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
jre consists of JVM, and it uses JVM to run codes
What is compile time and run time?
Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable while Run-time is the instance where the executable is running

What is heap?
A heap is a binary tree inside an array, so it does not use parent/child pointers
How java manage it's memory?
Overall, we can say that memory is divided into three parts — Stack, Heap and non-Heap.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
What is Singleton class?
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
when to use transient variable in java?
Difference between while and do..while loop?
